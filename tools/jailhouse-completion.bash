# usage: - include the directory containing the `jailhouse`-tool into your
#          ${PATH}-variable
#        - source this tile `. tools/jailhouse_bashcompletion`
#        - alternatively you can but this file into your distributions
#          bash-completion directory
#
#          there is a broad variety of places where distris may put this:
#               - /usr/share/bash-completion/
#               - /etc/bash_completion.d/
#               - $BASH_COMPLETION_COMPAT_DIR
#               - $BASH_COMPLETION_DIR
#               - ...

# dependencies: - bash-completion (>= 1.3) package installed and activated in
#                 your bash

# bash-completion websites:
#     - http://bash-completion.alioth.debian.org/
#     - https://wiki.debian.org/Teams/BashCompletion
#     - http://anonscm.debian.org/cgit/bash-completion/bash-completion.git/
